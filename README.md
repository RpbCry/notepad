# Notepad Application
The Notepad application is a simple text editor built using Python's tkinter library. It provides basic text editing features, as well as text formatting options for bold and italic. Additionally, it includes a find/replace functionality to search and highlight occurrences of specific text within the document.

## Features
Create new text files and open existing text files from your computer.
Save edited files with custom names and extensions.
Perform text editing operations: cut, copy, paste, and select all.
Apply text formatting options: toggle bold and toggle italic for selected text.
Search and highlight occurrences of specific text within the document.

## Requirements
Python 3.x (3.6 or higher recommended)

## How to Run
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Clone this repository or download the notepad.py file.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing notepad.py.
Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended).
Activate the virtual environment (if you created one).
Run the Notepad application using the following command:
python notepad.py

## Usage
After running the application, you will see a simple GUI window with a text area.
Use the "File" menu to create a new file, open an existing file, save the file, or save it with a different name.
